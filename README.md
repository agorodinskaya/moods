# General:
The App recognises the users face and plays music based on the chosen mood, projecting it on Raspberry pi. It also uses the users voice to change the background colour of the app.



_Specifications of languages, libraries and frameworks used_ :
- Ruby on Rails - Back-end 
- React - Front-end 
- Webpack - allowing to compile React and Ruby on Rails 
- Axios - promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js 
- Musicbox - software allowing to listen to music on Raspberry pi 
- Mopidy - HTTP server allowing to stream music on Raspberry pi from e.g. Spotify 
- Web Speech API - built in browser speech recognition and synthesis API 
- Raspberry Pi - small single-board computer. 

_Wishlist_ : 
- I would like to add more features to the website: e.g. RGB lights depending on the mood, add one more Raspberry pi, add Emotional recognition API for face and voice etc. 

_Known bugs_:
- nothing known so far.
